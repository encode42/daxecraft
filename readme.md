# daxecraft
The client and server pack for daxe's community Minecraft server.

It has been designed to work with vanilla clients, only modifying server-side behavior. The client side of the pack is optional, including pre-configured tweaks and connected mods such as [Customizable Player Models](https://modrinth.com/plugin/custom-player-models) and [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat).

On the server's side, not much has been changed from Vanilla behavior. Simple Voice Chat, [Pl3xMap](https://modrinth.com/plugin/pl3xmap), and [AutoWhitelist](https://modrinth.com/mod/autowhitelist) have been pre-configured according to the allocations provided by Modrinth Hosting. Many administration mods are included to keep players protected without restricting player experience. Quality of life mods may be added over time!

Overall, the current goal is to keep the server simple. It may pivot to a fully modded experience in the future, however, the server will always have its roots in vanilla Minecraft.

### Server Pack
Other than the server's world, the server is designed to be stateless. Everything that defines the server is contained within this pack as well! Thanks to Modrinth Hosting, who provided the server, for implementing an easy way to install and update server mod packs.

### Credits
No third-party projects are packaged within the mod pack file. The credits for these projects will be found [in the `credits.md` file](credits.md). This file will be included in the pack's export as well!
